* I have used XAMPP for MySQL and apache server. (You can download it(XAMPP) form the official website).

* Use any editor (Atom, Sublime Text, Brackets, ets.)

* Create a server with a name your choice (By default it is 'myproject').

* You can create the MySQL server by 
	
	-> Open the XAMPP application.

	-> Start MySQL and apache server.
	
	-> Go to your browser and type 'http://localhost/phpmyadmin/'.

	-> There you can create the server.

* If you have created the server with the name of your choice then change the server name in dblogin.php and dbregister.php file, if not then keep as it is.

* Copy the files in htdocs in the XAMPP installed folder.

* Then go to any brower (NOTE: MySQL and Apache server should be running) and type 'http://localhost/Folder_name/'. ('Folder_name' of your choice in htdocs).
